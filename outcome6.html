    <p>For a lot of the planning I used Trello, it let me divide my tasks into manageable sections so I could easily plan how the project would be completed. It uses boards which can be written on to split up the planning, these boards can be put into different categories to organise. One method of categorising is using Kanban which is dividing the planning into “to do, doing and done”. So if something is done it’ll be put in the done section, something that needs to be done will be put in to do.</p>
