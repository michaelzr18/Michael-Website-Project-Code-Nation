 <p>It’s very important to make sure you have access to all the required resources to carry out a successful digital project. For example, if you’re making a website which will display your art you will need a way of creating the art and then uploading it. So, you need to decide what your art will be made on, this could be on a piece of paper or on a computer using software like photoshop. If it was drawn on paper, a scanner will be needed to upload it to a file that the computer can then use. If it’s done on photoshop it will need to be compressed and then exported as a filetype. </p>

<div id="outcome22"> 
 <p>So, it’s very important to do effective research on what will be needed and what knowledge is needed to carry out the project to make sure everything is prepared before actually starting. This will help minimise gaps in productivity which will waste time, this could lead to a rushed project. It’s also okay to do some research during the project to make sure everything is being done correctly but the majority of it should be done before starting.</p>
