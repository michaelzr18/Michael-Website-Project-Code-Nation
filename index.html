    <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
    <div id="abtmepara1">
    <p>Hi, my name is Michael and I’m currently on a 3 week course with code nation. In my spare time I usually play games or watch movies/tv series. I usually play PC games but I’m also a fan of nintendo, with my favorite titles being: The Legend of Zelda, Mario Kart, Metroid and Pokémon Fire Red/Sapphire. My favorite PC games are: Witcher 3, Fallout 3/New Vegas, Skyrim and Mass Effect 1-3.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="abtmepara2">
    <p>I am a fan of watching films, which can include new and old films, and TV series, Friends and The Office (american version) . Examples of films that I like are: Star Wars Episode 5, Drive, Ferris Bueller’s Day off, The Dark Knight and Temple of Doom. I also have a broad taste in music ranging from cheesy 2000s pop to heavy metal, so a lot of diversity. </p>
    </div>
    <div id="abtmepara3">
    <p>I decided to start doing the course because I did some coding at college but didn’t have the time to dedicate myself to it so I’m doing it again, It’s very enjoyable. I am hoping to land an apprenticeship and move onto the masters course because it would be a career I will really enjoy. The area of coding I would like to go into, would be game development because I have played a lot of games in the past so have a lot of knowledge of the industry.</p>
