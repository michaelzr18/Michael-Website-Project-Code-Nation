    <p>One of the most major legal constraints that could impact digital projects is copyright law. This law makes it so you can’t use someone else’s work unless they give permission for it to be used. For example, if your project is to make a short film and you include music made by someone else without their permission, you would be breaching copyright law. So, if the short movie was uploaded they could have it taken down because you’ve used their work. There are some sources that are free to use because the creator has stated this, but otherwise permission will be needed to use another person's work. </p>

    <p>GDPR, General Data Protection Regulation, was introduced in May 2018 and changed how data is used drastically.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="outcomelist">
    <p>There are 8 rights the user has with their data which are:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>The right to access</li>
    <li>The right to be forgotten</li>
    <li>The right to data portability</li>
    <li>The right to be informed</li>
    <li>the right to have information corrected</li>
    <li>The right to restrict processing</li>
    <li>The right to object</li>
    <li>The right to be notified</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="outcome73">
    <p>This regulation changed how personal data is handled and makes it so personal data
            has to be handled much more carefully. So, if you were making a website which stored personal data, like email addresses, phone numbers and names, you would have to make sure the data is safely and readily accessible when needed. This is because the user can request their information at any time and it must be given, this will include how the data is being used. If they wish to remove their data then it has to be removed completely, there can be massive repercussions for not abiding by this regulation so it’s very important the project sticks to it. https://www.superoffice.com/blog/
