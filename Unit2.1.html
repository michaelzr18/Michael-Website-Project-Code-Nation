    <h3>Describe the content and layout for each page:</h3>
    <p>
        For the website I have decided to put a question and answer on each individual page because I think this will break it up nicely. To navigate to each webpage there will be a bar with links to the different sections, so it’ll be easy to use. I will have a consistent theme running throughout the website so the theme doesn’t become too distracting, which will make it hard to concentrate on the text.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am going with a Fallout theme because I can make the website look like a terminal, with buttons allowing the user to navigate. I am going to make the text colour change have a background fade in when the user hovers over a paragraph, this will make it stand out and easy to read. I might also add an overlay to the first webpage, the index, which will be a Fallout loading screen to keep up with the theme.

    <h3>Describe copyright and other constraints affecting websites:</h3>
    <p>
        One of the most major legal constraints that could impact digital projects is copyright law. This law makes it so you can’t use someone else’s work unless they give permission for it to be used. For example, if your project is to make a short film and you include music made by someone else without their permission, you would be breaching copyright law. So, if the short movie was uploaded they could have it taken down because you’ve used their work. There are some sources that are free to use because the creator has stated this, but otherwise permission will be needed to use another person's work.

    <h3>Describe access issues that need taking into account:</h3>
    <p>
        A website needs to be accessible for everyone, this includes making is usable on all devices or to people with disabilities. There are 4 principles that need to be taken into account to make sure that the website is accessible, these are: perceivable, operable, understandable and robust.
    </p>
     </div>  
    <div id="list1">
    <p>
        To make the website perceivable to all, it needs to:
        <ul>
        <li>Have captions for videos</li>
        <li>Have text that shows clearly against the background</li>
        <li>Not just use colour to distinguish something</li>
        <li>Make sure the website is responsive on all devices and let the user pick the font size they want to use</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    </div>
    <div id="list2">
    <p>
        To make a website operable, it needs to:
        <ul>
        <li>Have the option to play/stop moving content</li>
        <li>Use descriptive titles for pages</li>
        <li>Make sure it works with just a keyboard</li>
        <li>Make sure the user knows where a link will take them</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    </div>
    <div id="list3">
    <p>
        To make sure a website is understandable, it needs to:
        <ul>
        <li>Keep sentences short</li>
        <li>Use plain english text</li>
        <li>Make sure the website features work in a predictable way</li>
        <li>Not use abbreviations without explaining to the user what they are</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    </div>
    <div id="list4">
    <p>
        For the website to be robust it needs to:
        <ul>
        <li>Allow assistive technology to know what each user interface component is for</li>
        <li>Let the user return to what they were doing after interacting with an input</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Describe which are the appropiate file types for websites:</h3>
    <p>
        There are multiple file-types which can be used when making websites, these file types have different uses. The main ones when making a website are CSS and HTML, these are usually used in combination to make a website. Hyper-Text Markup Language (HTML) is used to give a website it’s content, headings, paragraphs of text and making navigation links. A website just made with HTML will have all the content but it will look terrible and not be very accessible. So, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to alter how the information is presented, this includes changing font, backgrounds, font colours and adding/positioning images. 
    </p>
    <p>
        There are multiple image file-types which are used in websites, examples of these are .GIF, .JPG/JPEG and .PNG. Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) is mostly used because it can be animated which makes it suitable to make banners with moving images. They can be interlaced as well, which means having more layers added to a base layer, this means the user will be able to see the image much faster. Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) is used for photos, this is because it can display millions of colours allowing for more complex images. They can be compressed to reduce the file size but this also reduces the quality, so if there was no compression the image would be perfect but if there’s a 90% compression ratio the image would lose a lot of its quality
    </p>
    <p>
        The final image type commonly used for website images is Portable Network Graphics (PNG). There are multiple versions of PNG but the most popular are PNG-8 and PNG-24 with the numbers corresponding to the colour support in bits. PNG-8 is used as an alternative to GIF, because they both can show 256 colours but PNG-8’s file size is much smaller, due to PNG-8 saving colours more efficiently. PNG-24 has a similar colour range to JPEG but doesn’t replace it because of its poor compression ratio, so a JPEG can achieve a similar quality with a smaller file size.
