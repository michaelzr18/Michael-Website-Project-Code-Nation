    <h1>PURPOSE OF IT IN A MODERN BUSINESS</h1>

   <div id="outcome11"> 
   <p>IT is used to streamline a lot of processes within a business, an example of this is to have an accounting database on the server to keep track of all the company's incomings and outgoings. This data can be encrypted and have a password to make it more secure because it’s sensitive information.</p>
   </div>
   <div id="outcome12">
    <p>It’s also very easy to send information from one computer to another. So, an example of this is an email can be sent from one branch of a company to another branch. This creates an instant channel of communication no matter the distance which can be invaluable. Furthermore, this email can be encrypted so sensitive information can be sent safely and only be read by the person it’s intended to go to.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="outcome13">
    <p>Finally, information for a company can be easily backed up to external drives or it can be uploaded to a cloud server that isn’t in the company. So, if there was a fire at the company, all the data wouldn’t be lost and could be easily restored. Another benefit of uploading to a cloud server, is that multiple people could access the data at the same time from anywhere which means no time will be lost whilst waiting to get access. </p>
