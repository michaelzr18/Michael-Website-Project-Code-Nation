<div id="outcome41">
<p>I think the most frequent reason for most digital projects failing is poor planning. If inefficient planning is done for a project it leads to tasks being carried out in the wrong order or maybe some tasks getting forgotten about which will get rushed at the end of the project. Also, too much time could be spent on a less important task which means less time can be spent on more important stuff. Time allocation is a part of planning and is very important since it dictates how much time will be spent on each task.

<div id="outcome42">
<p>Backing up data is very important on a digital project because if something was to go wrong, you would have another copy that still works and will be safe. For example, if all the work is being done on one computer and the storage becomes corrupted, everything would be lost and the project will have to be started again. So, to counteract this the data could be stored on an external drive as well to keep the data safe. If all the data was to be lost the day before the project submission, it would be nearly impossible to complete it to a good standard in time.</p>
