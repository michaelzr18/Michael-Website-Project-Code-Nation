        <h3> Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello </h3>
    <p>
        I am happy with my use of Visual Studio Code because it makes HTML very easy by having preprogrammed commands. So, if I type “!” at the start of a new HTML file it will give a base structure with a body which the HTML content can be written into, which is very helpful. Also commands like background-alignment and font-family are built into the software so if you can easily find it if you forget the name, which is easy to do due to the amount of tags in CSS/HTML.
    </p>
    <p>
        For the planning I used Trello because I could split my tasks into manageable and organised sections. I used Kanban style which is splitting tasks into: to do, doing and done. This helped a lot because I could easily know what I need to finish and what I need to start next. Also, if I decided I wasn’t happy with something I had done I could move it back to the “to do” section so I remember to change it.

        <h3>Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello</h3>
    <p>
        I think the use of VS Code and Trello was appropriate because they made my job of building a website, relatively simple. Trello made the planning process easy by allowing me to split the tasks and in turn made it easy to follow when building my website, so I knew what I needed to do throughout the project.
    </p>
    <p>
        VS Code was also easy to use because it has a lot of the commands pre-programmed so it made using different styles very simple. Furthermore, the HTML template it has is very useful when making multiple HTML pages, it saves time that would be spent typing out the same thing over and over again.
    </p>
    <p>      
        The only issue I had during the project was the laptop battery because sometimes it would only last for 2 hours which meant I had to take long breaks just waiting for it to charge. If I was to make a website again I would make sure I had a way of charging the laptop whilst I’m using it so work wouldn’t be interrupted.

        <h3> Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project</h3>
    <p>
        Overall I am happy with the outcome of my website because I was able to stick to my theme and be able to display all the information I needed to. I was able to use the hover function to create a background behind the text when I hovered the mouse over the text, this made the text easier to read. I stuck to a theme of fallout for Unit 1 and I changed the theme to Zelda for Unit 2 to keep them seperate. I thought this was successful but I wish I did a bit more with Unit 2. I ended up leaving it basic because I didn’t have the time to add different effects.
    </p>
    <p>        
        I could have added more techniques to my website, for example I was going to have an image change when the text is scrolled but I was unable to do this so I had to leave this. Given more time I would have been able to do it I think and it would have looked very good. Also, I could have included a bit more depth to my answers to make sure they cover more topics.

        <h3>Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h3>
    <p>
        The major improvement I could have made to my website is making it work properly on mobile devices. I know I would need to use media queries to do this but I just didn’t have the time to do it, so next time I will make sure I prioritise this since it should be able to work on all devices.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another improvement I could have made is having multiple font choices so people could select which font they like. This is because people might struggle to read certain fonts so having the option to change the font is good. Also, being able to change the font colour would be a good feature so the text is easy to read.

        <h3>Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</h3>
    <p>
        I think I have added sufficient depth to the outcomes so they have the information they need in them. I discussed the tools and methods I used to make the website so if someone else were to make a website they could use my outcomes for some guidelines. The outcomes are easy to read on the website because I made sure the text stood out from the background, making it more usable. I could have made the outcomes more accessible on a mobile device and this is something I will work on when making another website.
