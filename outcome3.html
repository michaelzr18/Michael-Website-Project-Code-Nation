<h1>Plan and carry out tasks using IT</h1>
</div>
<div id="outcome31">
<p>One of the main methods needed to make successful project is planning. This can be done in a wide range of ways but it needs to be efficient since poor planning usually leads to a poor project. One way of planning is using software like Trello which allows you to make different sections to sort the project into different sections.</p>
</div>
<div id="outcome32">
<p>For example, there’s a style of planning called Kanban which is split into 3 sections of; to do, doing and done. This lays the project planning out in a way so you know what needs to be done, what is being done and what is done. The great thing about Kanban is something can be moved if required, an example of this is if you’re making a website and you select a font it would go to done. However, you realise you will need to change the font by the end of the project so you can move the font part of the plan back to the “To do” section so you know it needs to be done.</p>
</div>
<div id="outcome33">
<p>Another aspect of planning is time management, which is important because you need to actually give yourself enough time to do everything you want to do. To be effective at time management you need to know which parts of the project are more important, thus needing more time dedicated to them. Furthermore, some sections of the project may need to be dropped if you begin to run out of time. So, to conclude planning is going to be used throughout the length of the project because the planning may change.</p>
