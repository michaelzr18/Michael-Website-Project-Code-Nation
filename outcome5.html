   <div id="outcome51">
    <p>Selecting what IT system and what software will be used during a project is crucial because the project can’t be carried out efficiently without the correct tools. The first thing to do when deciding on the correct tools would be to think about how the project would be carried out. For example, to make a website, it's very important to make sure there is access to a computer with the required software on it.</p>
   </div>
   <div id="outcome52">
    <p>For this website project we’ve been given a laptop each which has the required coding software already put onto it. There have been limitations with these laptops though because the battery only lasts for half of the day so they need to be charged which results in time being lost. There is a rule where there can’t trailing cables so there is no way to work whilst they charge. So for next time I would make sure there is a way of charging the laptops, this could include an external power source that can be plugged directly into the laptop. </p>
   </div>
   <div id="outcome53">
    <p>It’s important to do some research on the equipment before using it to make sure it’ll do what you want. This can include something simple like reading reviews to see if people had any issues you could run into. Research should be done for software as well so you are familiar with how to use it before you start doing work with it. This can be figuring out the most efficient way of using it.</p>
