        <h3> Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency</h3>
        <p>
            I could have used Trello a lot more for the planning of my website because I would sometimes end up not being sure on what I had to do next. So, next time I would do more planning beforehand so I could manage my time effectively and also make a higher quality website. As I mentioned in previous sections, I was having issues with the laptop battery which meant I lost a lot of time waiting for the laptop to charge. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I think working on a team would have been beneficial because the website tasks could have been split into manageable sizes. Having more people focussing on the website means different sections can be focussed on and have more time invested into them. This means more features can be added to the website and overall a better end product can be made.

    <div id="unit3-2">
        <h3>Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency </h3>
        <p>
            A set out plan should be made before starting a website so time can be allocated to different tasks so the correct time is spent on each task. For example, more time should be allocated to writing the content of the website than deciding on what picture to use. Also, as I said before, working in a team will boost productivity because the tasks will be split between multiple people, so they can be focussed on different sections of the website.

        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="unit3-3">
        <h3> Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects</h3>
        <p>
            If I was to make a website again I would do some things differently to boost my own productivity. One of these is allocating time to different tasks properly so I know what I need to do and how much time to spend doing it. For example, I spent a lot of time on the features of the website but not as much on the usability so it doesn’t work very well on a mobile device. 
        </p>
        <p>
            As mentioned before, I could have done it as a team instead of solo because the tasks can be split up for maximum efficiency. I could also send myself the folder after everyday so I could work on the website at home because I could have put more time into it which would have resulted in a better website. Furthermore, I could have completed all the written content before starting the website because I would get distracted with the coding and let the written content fall behind.

        <h3>Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h3>
        <p>
            The method I used to test my website is I had people try to use my website and ask them if the content is readable and if it was easy to use. I did this throughout development so I could see what people liked and didn’t like, this meant I could make changes accordingly. To make this better I could have given out questionnaires to refine the feedback I got and to make it more relevant. Also, I would have been able to record the feedback so I could have looked back on it to make sure I made the improvements needed. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I could have split the website into sections as well and tested each section individually to make sure it all worked correctly. This would have let me be able to know which section needs an improvement and which doesn’t. Also, I could have had people test individual sections to see what they think as well so I could get a broader perspective.
